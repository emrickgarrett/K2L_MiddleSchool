================

Base Project for my Kode2Learn Class. Just a Sandbox for them to draw and have fun with.

Feel free to copy/clone and change how you like. I will be adding notes and functions for them as needed.

The current help.txt is very rough, I plan on creating a styled HTML page so it's easier for you guys to read over break.
